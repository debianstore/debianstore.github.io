When some text is selected on any window and the hot-key is pressed, it pops-up with the word looked-up. Should the user prefer passive notifications, this can be done by enabling the notifications option.</p>\n    <p>When the term looked for is vague/not known, then either the search can be broadened with the use of regular expressions (*, ?, etc.) in the search string or spelling suggestions when a term is incorrect.</p>\n    <p>For regular expressions based search to work, wordnet-sense-index package is required.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"Languages"},{"name":"Literature"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"artha","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/artha_artha.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/artha_artha.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
