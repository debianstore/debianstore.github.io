{"flatpakAppId":"pianobooster.desktop","name":"Piano Booster","summary":"Learn the piano just by playing a game","description":"\n    <p>A MIDI file player/game that displays the musical notes AND teaches you how to play the piano.</p>\n    <p>PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation. The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard MIDI file is that PianoBooster listens and reacts to what you are playing on a MIDI keyboard.</p>\n    <p>To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out PianoBooster, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano is really recommended.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Music"},{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"pianobooster","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/pianobooster_pianobooster.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/pianobooster_pianobooster.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
