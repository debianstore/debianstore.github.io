It also has the option of conjugating verbs as ordinary Brazilians do. In fact, Brazilians of different regions deviate from the normative grammar in different ways, but the conjugation displayed will already help foreigners to grasp what Brazilians are saying.</p>\n    <p>This program is a graphical interface. Alternatively, you can use conjugar, the text only version for gconjugue.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gconjugue","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gconjugue_gconjugue.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gconjugue_gconjugue.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
