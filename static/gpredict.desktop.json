{"flatpakAppId":"gpredict.desktop","name":"Gpredict","summary":"Satellite tracker","description":"\n    <p>Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program for the Linux desktop. It uses the SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).</p>\n    <p>Some core features of Gpredict include:</p>\n    <p> * Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical    memory and processing power of the computer  * Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination    of these  * Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own    windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode  * You can use many ground stations  * Predict upcoming passes  * Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and    backward), and manual time control  * Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes  * Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld  * Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"HamRadio"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Astronomy"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Network"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gpredict","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gpredict_gpredict-icon.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gpredict_gpredict-icon.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
