As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are introduced which make things more difficult and interesting as you progress through the many levels. You can use the infinite undo feature to retrace your steps if you make a mistake. You can take as long as you like to complete each level.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"KidsGame"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"hex-a-hop","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/h/he/hex-a-hop.desktop/abb9672f8dea5e2cd29befb6f408e255/icons/128x128/hex-a-hop_hex-a-hop.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/h/he/hex-a-hop.desktop/abb9672f8dea5e2cd29befb6f408e255/icons/128x128/hex-a-hop_hex-a-hop.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
