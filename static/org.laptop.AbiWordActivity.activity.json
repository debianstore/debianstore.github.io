Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.</p>\n    <p>Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software packages that automatically save your work - producing specific instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may be invited to join a collective Activity session.</p>\n    <p>The Write activity serves as a basic text editing application.  Its simple interface provides an easy starting point for children, presenting tools that make writing a story, poem or essay simple and straightforward.  It also supports basic tools for inserting images, creating tables, and performing basic layout operations as children begin to require some of these features often associated with word processors.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"sugar-write-activity","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-write-activity_activity-write.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-write-activity_activity-write.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
