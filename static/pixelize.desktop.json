Each area is analyzed, and replaced with an image chosen from a large database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that best match each area.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"pixelize","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/pixelize_pixelize.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/pixelize_pixelize.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
