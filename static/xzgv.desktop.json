{"flatpakAppId":"xzgv.desktop","name":"xzgv Image Viewer","summary":"Lightweight image viewer","description":"\n    <p>xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector. Most file formats are supported, and the thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector.</p>\n    <p>xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures, and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's aspect ratio.</p>\n    <p>It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.</p>\n    <p>Note that this program is written by the author of the svgalib-based \"zgv\", and has similar features.</p>\n    <p>Home Page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xzgv</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"Viewer"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"xzgv","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/xzgv_xzgv.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/xzgv_xzgv.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
