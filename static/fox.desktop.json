{"flatpakAppId":"fox.desktop","name":"Fox","summary":"Crystal structure determination","description":"\n    <p>FOX is a program for the ab initio structure determination from powder diffraction (neutrons, X-Ray). The crystal structure can be described as any combination of atoms, molecules or polyhedra, without a priori information about the connectivity of these 'building block'. Fox can make multi-pattern global optimizations, and automatically correct special positions.</p>\n    <p>FOX could also be used for educational purposes, to display Crystal Structures in 3D with the associated powder diffraction pattern.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"DataVisualization"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"objcryst-fox","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/objcryst-fox_fox.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/objcryst-fox_fox.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
