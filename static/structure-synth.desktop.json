Even simple systems may generate surprising and complex structures. Structure Synth offers a graphical environment with multiple tabs, syntax highlighting, and OpenGL preview. Integration with third-party renderers (such as Sunflow and POV-Ray) is possible using a flexible template based export system.</p>\n    <p>Structure Synth has been developed by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. It was inspired by the CFDG syntax by Chris Coyne, and the Context Free Art GUI by Mark Lentczner and John Horigan.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"structure-synth","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/structure-synth_structure-synth.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/structure-synth_structure-synth.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
