It provides DEC VT102 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.</p>\n    <p>This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.</p>\n    <p>A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.</p>\n    <p>The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.</p>\n    <p>Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the xfonts-cyrillic package as well.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"System"},{"name":"TerminalEmulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"xterm","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/d/de/debian-xterm.desktop/88e850b6f24d6cf46ea642339e8de277/icons/128x128/xterm_mini.xterm.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/d/de/debian-xterm.desktop/88e850b6f24d6cf46ea642339e8de277/icons/128x128/xterm_mini.xterm.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
