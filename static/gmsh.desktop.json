Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.</p>\n    <p>See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's capabilities.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Math"},{"name":"Science"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gmsh","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/g/gm/gmsh.desktop/b3b904721f76e064429d2bdab6013c93/icons/128x128/gmsh_gmsh.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/g/gm/gmsh.desktop/b3b904721f76e064429d2bdab6013c93/icons/128x128/gmsh_gmsh.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
