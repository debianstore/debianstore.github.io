It supports a set of graphics primitives that make it suitable for many types of graphs, plots, and other illustrations; although its first use was to display macromolecular structures for biophysical research. KiNG builds on Mage, JavaMage, and the \"kinemage\" (kinetic image) concept to deliver a full-featured Java application with a user-friendly interface and integrated editing features. The KiNG jar file can be used within a web page as a Java applet or Java object to promote easy access to kinemages or coordinate files from a web browser.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Chemistry"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"king","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/king_kingicon-orig.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/king_kingicon-orig.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
