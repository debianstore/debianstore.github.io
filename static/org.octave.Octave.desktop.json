{"flatpakAppId":"org.octave.Octave.desktop","name":"GNU Octave","summary":"Interactive programming environment for numerical computations","description":"\n    <p>\n      GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for\n      numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical\n      solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other\n      numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities\n      for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through\n      its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write\n      non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to\n      Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra\n      problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary\n      functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary\n      differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily\n      extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in\n      Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in\n      C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-3.0+","homepageUrl":"https://www.octave.org/","donationUrl":"https://www.octave.org/donate.html","translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://bugs.octave.org/","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Math"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"octave","currentReleaseVersion":"8.3.0","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/octave/Octave.desktop/ef22fcbf6e6a68d8561207de08af2d7c/icons/128x128/octave_octave.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/octave/Octave.desktop/ef22fcbf6e6a68d8561207de08af2d7c/icons/128x128/octave_octave.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/octave/Octave.desktop/ef22fcbf6e6a68d8561207de08af2d7c/screenshots/image-1_224x126.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/octave/Octave.desktop/ef22fcbf6e6a68d8561207de08af2d7c/screenshots/image-1_1248x702.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/octave/Octave.desktop/ef22fcbf6e6a68d8561207de08af2d7c/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2023-08-08","inStoreSinceDate":null}
