{"flatpakAppId":"zita-at1.desktop","name":"AT1","summary":"Correct the pitch of a voice singing out of tune","description":"\n    <p>AT1 is an 'autotuner', normally used to correct the pitch of a voice singing (slightly) out of tune. Compared to 'Autotalent' it provides an improved pitch estimation algorithm, and much cleaner resampling.</p>\n    <p>AT1 does not include formant correction, so it should be used to correct small errors only and not to really transpose a song. The 'expected' pitch can be controlled by Midi (via Jack only), or be a fixed set of notes. AT1 can probably be used on some instruments as well, but is primarily designed to cover the vocal range. It's also usable as a quick and dirty guitar tuner.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"zita-at1","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/z/zi/zita-at1.desktop/D0F3784885183C2743467E6C5B3045D1/icons/128x128/zita-at1_zita-at1.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/z/zi/zita-at1.desktop/D0F3784885183C2743467E6C5B3045D1/icons/128x128/zita-at1_zita-at1.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
