During the trip a number of MS Enterprises are saved, luckily, from the hands of the terrible Tentacle Monsters of an Unknown Master, who actually is your dad. Or then ain't. :-)</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ArcadeGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"bloboats","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/b/bl/bloboats.desktop/65a885dfcb73c7bca6ab559fdde76e5a/icons/128x128/bloboats_bloboats.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/b/bl/bloboats.desktop/65a885dfcb73c7bca6ab559fdde76e5a/icons/128x128/bloboats_bloboats.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
