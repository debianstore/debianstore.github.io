It follows a `keyhole surgery'' approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"AudioVideoEditing"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"dvbcut","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/dvbcut_dvbcut.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/dvbcut_dvbcut.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
