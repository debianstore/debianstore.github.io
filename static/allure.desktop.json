{"flatpakAppId":"allure.desktop","name":"Allure of the Stars","summary":"Explore an abandoned spaceship with a party of adventurers","description":"\n    <p>Allure of the Stars is a near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical squad game.</p>\n    <p>Not a single picture in this game. You have to imagine everything yourself, like with a book (a grown-up book, without pictures). Once you learn to imagine things, though, you can keep exploring and mastering the world and making up stories for a long time.</p>\n    <p>The game is written in Haskell using the free software LambdaHack engine. Please see the changelog file for recent improvements and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals are high replayability and auto-balancing through procedural content generation and persistent content modification based on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"allure","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/allure_allure.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/allure_allure.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
