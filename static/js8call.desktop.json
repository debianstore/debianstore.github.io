It is not designed for any specific purpose other than connecting amateur radio operators who are operating under weak signal conditions. JS8Call is heavily inspired by WSJT-X, Fldigi, and FSQCall and would not exist without the hard work and dedication of the many developers in the amateur radio community.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"},{"name":"HamRadio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"js8call","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/js8call_js8call_icon.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/js8call_js8call_icon.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
