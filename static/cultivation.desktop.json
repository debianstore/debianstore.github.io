It is a social simulation, and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant resources. There is no shooting, but there are plenty of angry looks. It is also an evolution simulation. Within the world of Cultivation, you can explore a virtually infinite spectrum of different plant and gardener varieties.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ArcadeGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"cultivation","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/c/cu/cultivation.desktop/8832fc223e43e558d7aaa4bf5f64ef01/icons/128x128/cultivation_cultivation.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/c/cu/cultivation.desktop/8832fc223e43e558d7aaa4bf5f64ef01/icons/128x128/cultivation_cultivation.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
