{"flatpakAppId":"yoshimi.desktop","name":"Yoshimi","summary":"A Software Synthesizer for Linux","description":"\n    <p>\n    Yoshimi is a MIDI software synthesizer for Linux. It synthesizes in real time, can run polyphonic and/or monophonic\nin multiple simultaneous patches in one or more MIDI channels and has broad microtonal capability. It includes extensive additive, subtractive, and PAD synth capabilities which can be run simultaneously within the same patch. It also has comprehensive effects capabilities.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of ZynAddSubFX (Copyright 2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul), development of Yoshimi\nhas continued for quite a while now in its own direction. Originally these included major optimizations for audio and MIDI performance. More recently there has been progressive development of user-level access to all controls, including command line access. Since V1.5.0 there is full Midi Learn capability.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    In the V1.7.x series ALSA MIDI can search for and connect to all viable sources, almost all controls have been made\nrealtime, both key and channel aftertouch have been implemented and there is now the ability to change the panning law. Refinement continues, both visually and within the code.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Version 2.0 brings fully resizable windows, both key and channel aftertouch, MIDI sync for LFOs, and extensions to\npanning control.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Version 2.1.0 extends MIDI sync for Effects where relevant, and extensions to NRPNs. There is also an new HTML User\nGuide.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/yoshimi/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Music"},{"name":"Midi"},{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"yoshimi","currentReleaseVersion":"2.1.2.2","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/icons/128x128/yoshimi_yoshimi.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/icons/128x128/yoshimi_yoshimi.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-1_224x280.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-2_224x76.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-2_624x211.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-3_224x82.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/y/yo/yoshimi.desktop/7e906258a1cd91527cc0f8ecaa37809f/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2021-12-03","inStoreSinceDate":null}
