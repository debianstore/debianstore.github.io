{"flatpakAppId":"gnome-mastermind.desktop","name":"Mastermind","summary":"Break the hidden code!","description":"\n    <p>The goal of this board game is to break a code using obscure hints. The game is played by 2 players: the codemaker (the computer) and the codebreaker.  The computer generates a combination of 4 colors.  The codebreaker has to guess that pattern (both order and colors) with the least number of tries.  At each turn, the codebreaker tries a pattern and the computer provides feedback by placing pegs in the score grid.  A white peg indicates a right color but wrong position; a colored peg means that both color and position are correctly guessed.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"BoardGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gnome-mastermind","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/g/gn/gnome-mastermind.desktop/351858e400f0e49bf7feb2cdc0229272/icons/128x128/gnome-mastermind_gnome-mastermind.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/g/gn/gnome-mastermind.desktop/351858e400f0e49bf7feb2cdc0229272/icons/128x128/gnome-mastermind_gnome-mastermind.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
