Maybe it was the sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.</p>\n    <p>Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library \"Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)\" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel while taking advantage of some improvements.</p>\n    <p>The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ActionGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"wolf4sdl","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/wolf4sdl_wolf4sdl.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/wolf4sdl_wolf4sdl.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
