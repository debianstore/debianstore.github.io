This way, the connection to IRC can be kept up even when all frontends have been closed. The combination of screen and irssi served as example for this architecture.</p>\n    <p>Smuxi also supports the regular single application mode. This behaves like a typical IRC client; it doesn't need separate core management and utilizes a local engine that is used by the local frontend client.</p>\n    <p>This package contains the GNOME frontend of Smuxi, it can run either standalone using a local engine or connect to a running remote engine (server).</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Network"},{"name":"Chat"},{"name":"InstantMessaging"},{"name":"IRCClient"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"smuxi-frontend-gnome","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/s/sm/smuxi-frontend-gnome.desktop/9E3915ECA5CA18ACD8100DDD3B9CB25F/icons/128x128/smuxi-frontend-gnome_smuxi-frontend-gnome.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/s/sm/smuxi-frontend-gnome.desktop/9E3915ECA5CA18ACD8100DDD3B9CB25F/icons/128x128/smuxi-frontend-gnome_smuxi-frontend-gnome.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
