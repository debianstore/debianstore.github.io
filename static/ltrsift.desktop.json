Its user-friendly interface displays LTR retrotransposon candidates, their putative families and their internal structure in a hierarchical fashion, allowing the user to \"sift\" through the sometimes large results of de novo prediction software. It also offers customizable filtering and classification functionality.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Biology"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"ltrsift","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/l/lt/ltrsift.desktop/cbbc8e575da3eb6e9afc1f7aa366bba4/icons/128x128/ltrsift_ltrsift.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/l/lt/ltrsift.desktop/cbbc8e575da3eb6e9afc1f7aa366bba4/icons/128x128/ltrsift_ltrsift.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
