{"flatpakAppId":"buzztrax-edit.desktop","name":"Buzztrax Music Editor","summary":"Edit buzztrax song files","description":"\n    <p>Buzztrax aims to be a music studio that allows one to compose songs using only a computer with a soundcard. If youâ€™ve used tracker programs like FastTracker, Impulse Tracker, or the original AMIGA SoundTracker, that will give you an idea of how one can sequence music in Buzztrax. The Buzztrax editor uses a similar concept, where a song consists of a sequence with tracks and in each track one uses patterns with events (musical notes and control changes). In contrast to other Tracker programs, tracks are not simply sample players: a user can make a song using an arrangement of virtual audio plugins that are linked together to create different effects. Each of these machines can be controlled realtime or via patterns in the sequencer.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"},{"name":"Sequencer"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"buzztrax","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/b/bu/buzztrax-edit.desktop/5096ed6318f1ffb9d8c4ffa69f9d1a2b/icons/128x128/buzztrax_buzztrax.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/b/bu/buzztrax-edit.desktop/5096ed6318f1ffb9d8c4ffa69f9d1a2b/icons/128x128/buzztrax_buzztrax.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
