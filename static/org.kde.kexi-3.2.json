It can be used for designing database applications, inserting and editing data, performing queries, and processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to your data. All database objects - tables, queries, forms, reports - are stored in the database, making it easy to share data and design.</p>\n    <p>KEXI is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor for MS Access, Filemaker and Oracle Forms. Its development is motivated by the lack of Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for database systems that are sufficiently powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable across many operating systems and hardware platforms.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Office"},{"name":"Database"},{"name":"Development"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"kexi","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kexi-3.2/f9c6d0b4454b09c4d3ce1e99d09f93a3/icons/128x128/kexi_kexi-3.2.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kexi-3.2/f9c6d0b4454b09c4d3ce1e99d09f93a3/icons/128x128/kexi_kexi-3.2.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
