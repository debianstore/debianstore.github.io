It is a polished and improved version of the old LinCity game: You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time. This game is similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar name.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"Simulation"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"lincity-ng","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/l/li/lincity-ng.desktop/cb1e7a469e701e69cf48649ef22f0ac4/icons/128x128/lincity-ng_lincity-ng.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/l/li/lincity-ng.desktop/cb1e7a469e701e69cf48649ef22f0ac4/icons/128x128/lincity-ng_lincity-ng.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
