Your task is to complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and indeed your wont.  You (robot) are represented by the # character, and you move around with the arrow keys touching things.  If the thing you touch is kitten, you get a cute little animation (which was cuter in the DOS version) and the simulation ends. Otherwise, you get a brief description of what it is you touched.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"robotfindskitten","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/robotfindskitten_robotfindskitten.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/robotfindskitten_robotfindskitten.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
