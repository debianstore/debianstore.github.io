The Black Gate (including Forge of Virtue) and Serpent Isle (plus Silver Seed) are both playable to the end.  Some differences to the original games exist; see sections 5.3/5.4 of the FAQ.</p>\n    <p>While it is possible to use the engine for other games, no such game has been written yet. Therefore, Exult is useless unless you own a copy of one of the Ultima VIIs.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"RolePlaying"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"exult","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/exult_exult.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/exult_exult.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
