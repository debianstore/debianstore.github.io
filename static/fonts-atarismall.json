It only had a 320 pixel wide display, but an 80\n column terminal was wanted, hence there is this font. This is somewhat\n cleaned up from the original version. It has only a one pixel descent to\n maximize pixels available to the main body of each character.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"N/A","homepageUrl":"https://www.aiei.ch/atari/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"fonts-atarismall","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/f/fo/fonts-atarismall/4cd3b831dd6a5c69208ab14e61a795eb/icons/128x128@2/fonts-atarismall_\"atari800\"-medium.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/f/fo/fonts-atarismall/4cd3b831dd6a5c69208ab14e61a795eb/icons/128x128@2/fonts-atarismall_\"atari800\"-medium.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
