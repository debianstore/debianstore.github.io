Keyboard or gamepad are strongly recommended.</p>\n    <p>The game allows two players to compete on the same machine.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://blockattack.net","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/issues","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ArcadeGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"blockattack","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/icons/128x128/blockattack_blockattack.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/icons/128x128/blockattack_blockattack.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-1_224x126.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-1_1248x702.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-2_224x126.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-2_1248x702.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-3_224x126.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-3_1248x702.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/net/blockattack/game/0470d558fa1a8af5f64ff84f1a04ac23/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
