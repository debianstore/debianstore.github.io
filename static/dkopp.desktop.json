{"flatpakAppId":"dkopp.desktop","name":"dkopp","summary":"Full and incremental backup to DVD with verify","description":"\n    <p>Dkopp is a program used to copy or back-up disk files to DVD or BD (Blue-ray) media. Full or incremental backups can be done, with full or incremental media verification. A GUI is used to navigate through directories to select or de-select files or directories at any level. Backup jobs can be saved for later re-use. New, deleted, and updated disk files are handled automatically, without re-editing the backup job. An incremental backup updates the same DVD/BD media used for a prior full backup. Files can be restored to the same or another location on disk. Large backup jobs can be done using multiple DVD media.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"System"},{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"Archiving"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"dkopp","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/dkopp_dkopp.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/dkopp_dkopp.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
