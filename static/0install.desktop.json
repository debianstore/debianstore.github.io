{"flatpakAppId":"0install.desktop","name":"0install","summary":"Run or manage Zero Install programs","description":"\n    <p>Zero Install is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation system available under the LGPL. It allows software developers to publish programs directly from their own web-sites, while supporting features familiar from centralised distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic updates and digital signatures. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, the operating system's package management. 0install packages never interfere with those provided by the distribution.</p>\n    <p>This package includes the GTK GUI for 0install. If you have a headless system, install just the 0install-core package to avoid pulling in any GUI dependencies.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"Settings"},{"name":"PackageManager"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"0install","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/0/0i/0install.desktop/90d5c957dc81d93e5dc264f37e07b52a/icons/128x128/0install_zeroinstall.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/0/0i/0install.desktop/90d5c957dc81d93e5dc264f37e07b52a/icons/128x128/0install_zeroinstall.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
