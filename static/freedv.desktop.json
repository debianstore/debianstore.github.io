{"flatpakAppId":"freedv.desktop","name":"FreeDV","summary":"Digital Voice mode for HF Radio","description":"\n    <p>FreeDV is a digital voice mode intended for transmission and reception over high-frequency (HF) radio. It uses a frequency division multiplex (FDM) modem with 15 carriers and no forward error correction (FEC). A low bit-rate voice coder-decoder (Codec 2) provides voice quality without the listener fatigue caused by noise and interference normally associated with analog single sideband (SSB) voice. A HF SSB transceiver, personal computer and two sound cards are required. Path simulation and on-the-air HF testing have shown that decoding voice is possible at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 dB.</p>\n    <p>The FreeDV software was developed by David Rowe (Codec 2, FDM modem implementation, integration) and David Witten (GUI, architecture design). The FreeDV design and user interface was based on the earlier FDMDV program which was developed by Francesco Lanza. The FDM modem design and development was supported from Peter Martinez.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"},{"name":"HamRadio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"freedv","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/f/fr/freedv.desktop/136ab3d8a69b08cb8ee5946a4d6dd9ed/icons/128x128/freedv_freedv.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/f/fr/freedv.desktop/136ab3d8a69b08cb8ee5946a4d6dd9ed/icons/128x128/freedv_freedv.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
