It focuses on providing simple and usable user interface, yet powerful for efficient development.</p>\n    <p>Anjuta is very extensible with plugins. Almost all features in Anjuta are implemented using plugins which can be dynamically enabled or disabled. You can choose which plugins should be active for your project. Like the user interface layout, the set of active plugins is also persistent for each project making it easy to work on projects with various levels of complexity. Using plugins, you can extend Anjuta with your own features.</p>\n    <p>The project wizard lets you create new projects from a selection of project templates. The selection includes simple generic, flat (no subdirectory), GTK+, GNOME, Java, Python projects and more. New templates can be easily downloaded and installed.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://projects.gnome.org/anjuta/","donationUrl":"http://www.gnome.org/friends/","translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=anjuta","helpUrl":"https://developer.gnome.org/anjuta-manual/stable/","categories":[{"name":"Development"},{"name":"IDE"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"anjuta","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/a/an/anjuta.desktop/34177b29c06a046a240eaca9b977ba80/icons/128x128/anjuta_anjuta.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/a/an/anjuta.desktop/34177b29c06a046a240eaca9b977ba80/icons/128x128/anjuta_anjuta.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/a/an/anjuta.desktop/34177b29c06a046a240eaca9b977ba80/screenshots/image-1_224x170.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/a/an/anjuta.desktop/34177b29c06a046a240eaca9b977ba80/screenshots/image-1_752x573.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/a/an/anjuta.desktop/34177b29c06a046a240eaca9b977ba80/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
