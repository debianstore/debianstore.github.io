{"flatpakAppId":"gcx.desktop","name":"GCX Astro-Image Processor","summary":"Process astronomical images and control CCDs","description":"\n    <p>Gcx is an astronomical image processing and data reduction tool, with an easy to use graphical user interface. It provides a complete set of data reduction functions for CCD photometry, with frame WCS fitting, automatic star identification, aperture photometry of target and standard stars, single-frame ensemble photometry solution finding, multi-frame color coefficient fitting, extinction coefficient fitting, and all-sky photometry; as well as general-purpose astronomical image processing functions (bias, dark, flat, frame alignment and stacking); It can function as a FITS viewer.</p>\n    <p>The program can control CCD cameras and telescopes, and implement automatic observation scripting. Cameras are controlled through a hardware-specific server, to which gcx connects through a TCP socket. It generates FITS files with comprehensive header information.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Astronomy"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gcx","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gcx_gcx.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gcx_gcx.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
