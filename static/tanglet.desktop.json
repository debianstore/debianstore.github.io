The object of the game is to list as many words as you can before the time runs out. There are several timer modes that determine how much time you start with, and if you get extra time when you find a word.</p>\n    <p>You can join letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction to make a word, so as long as the letters are next to each other on the board. However, you can not reuse the same letter cells in a single word. Also, each word must be at least three letters on a normal board, and four letters on a large board.</p>\n  ","developerName":"Graeme Gott","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0+","homepageUrl":"https://gottcode.org/tanglet/","donationUrl":"https://gottcode.org/tip/","translateUrl":"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tanglet/","bugtrackerUrl":"https://gottcode.org/tanglet/bugs/","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"tanglet","currentReleaseVersion":"1.6.1.1","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/ta/tanglet.desktop/e11b32907d51a96efe9c56aa72b38d9a/icons/128x128/tanglet_tanglet.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/ta/tanglet.desktop/e11b32907d51a96efe9c56aa72b38d9a/icons/128x128/tanglet_tanglet.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/ta/tanglet.desktop/e11b32907d51a96efe9c56aa72b38d9a/screenshots/image-1_224x191.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/ta/tanglet.desktop/e11b32907d51a96efe9c56aa72b38d9a/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/ta/tanglet.desktop/e11b32907d51a96efe9c56aa72b38d9a/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2021-05-02","inStoreSinceDate":null}
