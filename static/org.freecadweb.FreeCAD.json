It is designed to fit a \n      wide range of uses including product design, mechanical \n      engineering, architecture and 3D printing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained \n      2D shapes and use them as a base to build other objects. \n      It contains many components to adjust dimensions or \n      extract design details from 3D models to create high \n      quality production-ready drawings. it is a multiplatfom \n      (Windows, Mac and Linux), highly customizable using the \n      Python language. It reads and writes to many open file \n      formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, \n      DAE and many others, making it possible to seamlessly \n      integrate it into your workflow. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      FreeCAD includes a modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) \n      tools, experimental CFD, BIM, Geodata workbenches, \n      a Path (CNC) workbench, a robot simulation module that \n      allows you to study robot movements and many more, and\n      a rich collection of plugins and macros installable\n      directly from within the application.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"LGPL-2.1","homepageUrl":"https://www.freecadweb.org","donationUrl":"https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Donate","translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://www.freecadweb.org/tracker","helpUrl":"https://forum.freecadweb.org","categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Engineering"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"freecad","currentReleaseVersion":"0.20.2","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/icons/128x128/freecad_org.freecadweb.FreeCAD.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/icons/128x128/freecad_org.freecadweb.FreeCAD.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-1_224x134.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-1_1248x748.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-2_224x112.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-2_624x313.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-3_224x92.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-3_752x312.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-4_224x148.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-4_1248x829.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/freecadweb/FreeCAD/3ac99fa220e1526cc8ee61b357f51b0a/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2023-09-04","inStoreSinceDate":null}
