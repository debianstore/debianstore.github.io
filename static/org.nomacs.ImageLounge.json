Metadata stored with the image can be \n        displayed and you can add notes to images. A thumbnail preview of \n        the current folder is included as well as a file explorer panel which \n        allows switching between folders. Within a directory you can apply a \n        file filter, so that only images are displayed whose filenames have a \n        certain string or match a regular expression. Activating the cache \n        allows for instantly switching between images.\n        </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-3.0","homepageUrl":"https://nomacs.org","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"RasterGraphics"},{"name":"Viewer"},{"name":"2DGraphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"nomacs","currentReleaseVersion":"3.17","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/nomacs/ImageLounge/7e65d3320478ecd5c86694911eeef680/icons/128x128/nomacs_org.nomacs.ImageLounge.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/nomacs/ImageLounge/7e65d3320478ecd5c86694911eeef680/icons/128x128/nomacs_org.nomacs.ImageLounge.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":"2023-09-06","inStoreSinceDate":null}
