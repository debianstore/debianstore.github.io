Compliance with existing or emerging VO standards, interconnection with other visualisation or analysis tools, and the ability to easily compare heterogeneous data are the key topics which allow Aladin to be a powerful data exploration and integration tool.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Astronomy"},{"name":"DataVisualization"},{"name":"Java"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Viewer"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"aladin","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/aladin_aladin.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/aladin_aladin.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
