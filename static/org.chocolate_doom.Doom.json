{"flatpakAppId":"org.chocolate_doom.Doom","name":"Chocolate Doom","summary":"Conservative source port","description":"\n    <p>\n      Chocolate Doom is a conservative,\n      historically-accurate Doom source port, which is compatible with\n      the thousands of mods and levels that were made before the Doom\n      source code was released.  Unlike other source ports, the goal\n      is to preserve the original look, feel, limitations, and bugs of\n      the original DOS executable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Full support for single- and multi-player games is provided, for\n      all of the original Doom games, Chex Quest, and Hacx.  Unlike\n      the original executable, network play is implemented on the IP\n      network stack, allowing it to function on modern LANs and the\n      Internet.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://www.chocolate-doom.org/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/issues","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ActionGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"chocolate-doom","currentReleaseVersion":"3.0.1","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/icons/128x128/chocolate-doom_chocolate-doom.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/icons/128x128/chocolate-doom_chocolate-doom.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-1_224x180.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-1_624x504.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-2_224x180.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-2_624x504.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-3_224x180.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-3_624x504.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-4_224x180.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-4_624x504.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/chocolate_doom/Doom/60b89a9bba8ab428846d3e78dc67d1c4/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2020-06-25","inStoreSinceDate":null}
