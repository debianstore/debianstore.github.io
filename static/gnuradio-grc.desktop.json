{"flatpakAppId":"gnuradio-grc.desktop","name":"GNU Radio Companion","summary":"Graphical tool for creating signal flow graphs and generating flow-graph source code with the GNU Radio framework","description":"\n    <p>GNU Radio provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.</p>\n    <p>GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming language, while the supplied performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions, where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.</p>\n    <p>While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.</p>\n    <p>This package contains the gnuradio-companion, a graphical tool for creating signal flow graphs and generating flow-graph source code. Also included are a variety of tools and utility programs.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Development"},{"name":"HamRadio"},{"name":"Science"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gnuradio","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/g/gn/gnuradio-grc.desktop/e5e1085f7d6405958ce43d3b3dfb0bb1/icons/128x128/gnuradio_gnuradio-grc.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/g/gn/gnuradio-grc.desktop/e5e1085f7d6405958ce43d3b3dfb0bb1/icons/128x128/gnuradio_gnuradio-grc.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
