The objective is to move the\n      patterned block to the area bordered by green markers. To do so, youâ€™ll need\n      to slide other blocks out of the way. Complete each puzzle in as few moves as\n      possible!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      GNOME Klotski comes with nearly thirty different puzzle layouts of varying\n      difficulty. Some of the layouts are similar and only the size of one or more\n      blocks differ. Other layouts have more variety.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":"The GNOME Project","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0+","homepageUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Klotski","donationUrl":"https://www.gnome.org/friends/","translateUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject","bugtrackerUrl":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-klotski/issues/","helpUrl":"https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-klotski/stable/","categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gnome-klotski","currentReleaseVersion":"3.38.2","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Klotski/0A8AAF9CB5F7DFAAF931003EA43A1E5C/icons/128x128/gnome-klotski_org.gnome.Klotski.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Klotski/0A8AAF9CB5F7DFAAF931003EA43A1E5C/icons/128x128/gnome-klotski_org.gnome.Klotski.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Klotski/0A8AAF9CB5F7DFAAF931003EA43A1E5C/screenshots/image-1_224x119.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Klotski/0A8AAF9CB5F7DFAAF931003EA43A1E5C/screenshots/image-1_624x332.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Klotski/0A8AAF9CB5F7DFAAF931003EA43A1E5C/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2020-11-22","inStoreSinceDate":null}
