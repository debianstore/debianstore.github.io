{"flatpakAppId":"openmotor.desktop","name":"OpenMotor","summary":"Design and simulate model rocket motors","description":"\n    <p>openMotor is an open-source internal ballistics simulator for rocket motor experimenters. The software produces estimates of a rocket motor's chamber pressure and thrust based on input such as propellant properties and grain geometry. It uses the Fast Marching Method to determine how a propellant grain regresses, which allows the use of arbitrary core geometries.</p>\n    <p>Current Features:   * Metric and imperial units   * Support for common grain geometries such as BATES, Finocyl, Star and more   * Loading custom grain geometry from DXF files   * A propellant editor that allows the user to enter the properties of as     many propellants as they wish   * The grain editor displays how a grain will regress to cut down on the     guesswork involved in tweaking geometry   * ENG file exporting   * Burnsim importing and exporting   * A UI that supports saving and loading designs along with undo and redo.</p>\n    <p>Planned Features:   * Erosivity simulation   * Detailed output of every calculated parameter at any time and position     along the motor</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Development"},{"name":"Science"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"openmotor","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/openmotor_oMIconCycles.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/openmotor_oMIconCycles.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
