The user can interact through many functions to choose the view, set the bindings, draw cutting planes, compute surfaces from scalar fields, duplicate nodes, measure geometry... Moreover V_Sim allows one to export the view as images in PNG, JPG, PDF (bitmap), SVG (scheme) and other formats. Some tools are also available to colorize atoms from data values or to animate on screen many position files.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Physics"},{"name":"Chemistry"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"v-sim","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/v/v-/v-sim.desktop/ace487276c373cfbd01b3913b09870b9/icons/128x128/v-sim_v_sim.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/v/v-/v-sim.desktop/ace487276c373cfbd01b3913b09870b9/icons/128x128/v-sim_v_sim.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
