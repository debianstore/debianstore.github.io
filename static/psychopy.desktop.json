It combines the graphical strengths of OpenGL with easy Python syntax to give psychophysics a free and simple stimulus presentation and control package.</p>\n    <p>The goal is to provide, for the busy scientist, tools to control timing and windowing and a simple set of pre-packaged stimuli and methods.  PsychoPy features</p>\n    <p> - IDE GUI for coding in a powerful scripting language (Python)  - Builder GUI for rapid development of stimulation sequences  - Use of hardware-accelerated graphics (OpenGL)  - Integration with Spectrascan PR650 for easy monitor calibration  - Simple routines for staircase and constant stimuli experimental    methods as well as curve-fitting and bootstrapping  - Simple (or complex) GUIs via wxPython  - Easy interfaces to joysticks, mice, sound cards etc. via PyGame  - Video playback (MPG, DivX, AVI, QuickTime, etc.) as stimuli</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"MedicalSoftware"},{"name":"Development"},{"name":"IDE"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"psychopy","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/psychopy_psychopy.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/psychopy_psychopy.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
