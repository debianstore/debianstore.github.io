Applications include:</p>\n    <p> * modeling 3d parts — draw with extrudes, revolves, and Boolean    (union / difference) operations;  * modeling 2d parts — draw the part as a single section, and export DXF,    PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit;  * 3d-printed parts — export the STL or other triangle mesh expected by    most 3d printers;  * preparing CAM data — export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine or    laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for import into third-party    CAM software for machining;  * mechanism design — use the constraint solver to simulate planar or    spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints;  * plane and solid geometry — replace hand-solved trigonometry and    spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"solvespace","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/s/so/solvespace.desktop/5691A1D9049E85300FC0DA96AF8E22C1/icons/128x128/solvespace_solvespace.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/s/so/solvespace.desktop/5691A1D9049E85300FC0DA96AF8E22C1/icons/128x128/solvespace_solvespace.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
