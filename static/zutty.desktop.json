It also offers high throughput with low latency, and strives to conform to relevant standards, either published or de-facto.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"System"},{"name":"TerminalEmulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"zutty","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/z/zu/zutty.desktop/cd83685bab62bede0e372fd596459520/icons/128x128/zutty_zutty.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/z/zu/zutty.desktop/cd83685bab62bede0e372fd596459520/icons/128x128/zutty_zutty.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
