{"flatpakAppId":"org.onionshare.OnionShare","name":"OnionShare","summary":"Securely and anonymously share a file of any size","description":"\n    <p>\n            OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously send and receive files. It works by starting a web server,\n            making it accessible as a Tor onion service, and generating an unguessable web address so others can\n            download files from you, or upload files to you. It does <em>not</em> require setting up a separate server\n            or using a third party file-sharing service.\n        </p>\n    <p>\n            If you want to send files to someone, OnionShare hosts them on your own computer and uses a Tor onion\n            service to make them temporarily accessible over the internet. The receiving user just needs to open the web\n            address in Tor Browser to download the files. If you want to receive files, OnionShare hosts an anonymous\n            dropbox directly on your computer and uses a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible over the\n            internet. Other users can upload files to you from by loading the web address in Tor Browser.\n        </p>\n  ","developerName":"Micah Lee","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0","homepageUrl":"https://onionshare.org/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/","helpUrl":"https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki/","categories":[{"name":"Network"},{"name":"FileTransfer"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"onionshare","currentReleaseVersion":"2.1","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/onionshare/OnionShare/B23D6CC616A9A70232DF123BA85C2C8C/icons/128x128/onionshare_org.onionshare.OnionShare.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/onionshare/OnionShare/B23D6CC616A9A70232DF123BA85C2C8C/icons/128x128/onionshare_org.onionshare.OnionShare.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":"2019-05-07","inStoreSinceDate":null}
