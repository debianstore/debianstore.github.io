Instead of simulating\n      internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates\n      Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance\n      and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate\n      Windows applications into your desktop.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"LGPL-2.1+","homepageUrl":"https://www.winehq.org/","donationUrl":"https://www.winehq.org/donate","translateUrl":"https://wiki.winehq.org/Translating","bugtrackerUrl":"https://bugs.winehq.org/","helpUrl":"https://wiki.winehq.org/","categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"System"},{"name":"Emulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"wine-development","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/winehq/wine.development/1a07dd908dba192308aa4dac72d854d3/icons/128x128/wine-development_wine-development.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/winehq/wine.development/1a07dd908dba192308aa4dac72d854d3/icons/128x128/wine-development_wine-development.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
