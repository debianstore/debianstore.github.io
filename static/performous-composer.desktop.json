It attempts to make the process easy by automating as much as possible while providing a simple and attractive interface to do the remaining manual work.</p>\n    <p>Key features of Composer include:</p>\n    <p> * Song pitch analysis based on the esteemed algorithms from Perfomous.  * Zoomable interface to quickly get an overview or doing very precise timing.  * Possibility to synthesize the notes to get a feel of their \"sound\".  * Import/export in various formats including:    * SingStar XML    * UltraStar TXT    * Frets on Fire MIDI</p>\n    <p>Composer has a rather distinguished workflow: for example, the lyrics are imported as a whole and each time you manually put a note in place, the others automatically adjust to take use of the new information in providing a better guess of the pitch and timing.  In a sense, you are not actually creating a song, but fixing and tuning the result of what the computer thinks the notes should be like.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Music"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"performous-composer","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/performous-composer_performous-composer.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/performous-composer_performous-composer.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
