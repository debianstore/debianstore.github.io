As input, Rockhopper takes RNA sequencing reads output by high-throughput sequencing technology (FASTQ, QSEQ, FASTA, SAM, or BAM files). Rockhopper supports the following tasks:\nReference based transcript assembly (when one or more reference genomes are available)Aligning reads to genomesAssembling transcriptsIdentifying transcript boundaries and novel transcripts such as small RNAsDe novo transcript assembly (when reference genomes are unavailable)Normalizing data from different experimentsQuantifying transcript abundanceTesting for differential gene expressionCharacterizing operon structuresVisualizing results in a genome browser</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Biology"},{"name":"DataVisualization"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"rockhopper","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/rockhopper_rockhopper.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/rockhopper_rockhopper.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
