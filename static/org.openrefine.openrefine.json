OpenRefine is not a web service but a desktop app that runs on your own computer, so you can process sensitive data with privacy.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"FileTools"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"openrefine","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/openrefine/openrefine/8ab74f7b9a00feef97615e2be3a4a7b4/icons/128x128/openrefine_openrefine.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/openrefine/openrefine/8ab74f7b9a00feef97615e2be3a4a7b4/icons/128x128/openrefine_openrefine.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
