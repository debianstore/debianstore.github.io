Creating, moving, or deleting files and folders is simple and fast.</p>\n    <p>Dolphin contains plenty of productivity features that will save you time. The multiple tabs and split view features allow navigating multiple folders at theÂ same time, and you can easily drag and drop files between views to move or copy them. Dolphin's right-click menu provides with many quick actions that let you compress, share, and duplicate files, among many other things. You can also add your own custom actions.</p>\n    <p>Dolphin is very lightweight, but at the same time, you can adapt it to your specific needs. This means that you can carry out your file management exactly the way you want to. Dolphin supports three different view modes: a classic grid view of all the files, a more detailed view, and a tree view.
