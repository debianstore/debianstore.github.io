It can also connect to an IBM AS/400 as a 5250 terminal using the AS/400's 3270 emulation.  The window created by x3270 can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly accurate representation of an IBM 3278 or 3279.</p>\n    <p>x3270 is similar to tn3270(1) and c3270(1) except that it is X-based, not curses-based.</p>\n    <p>x3270 implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270), and 1646 (LU name selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.</p>\n    <p>You will need to install x3270's fonts locally, or on your font-server - they are required.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"TerminalEmulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"x3270","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/x/x3/x3270.desktop/aa0d926a23f1eac1397ba125f298ff61/icons/128x128/x3270_x3270.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/x/x3/x3270.desktop/aa0d926a23f1eac1397ba125f298ff61/icons/128x128/x3270_x3270.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
