It has two large fonts built into it, but it can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits. It can also do some funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the \"shape\" extension so that the window is shaped like the digits.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Clock"},{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"Office"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"xdaliclock","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/xdaliclock_xdaliclock.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/xdaliclock_xdaliclock.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
