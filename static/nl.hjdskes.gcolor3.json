Color Picker enables\n    you to pick the color from any pixel on your screen.

Color Picker allows you to conveniently save and retrieve colors.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Color Picker is a color selection dialog written in GTK 3. It is much alike\n    Gcolor2, but uses the newer GTK version and other modernisations to better\n    integrate into your modern desktop.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://hjdskes.nl/projects/gcolor3/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3/issues","helpUrl":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3/issues","categories":[{"name":"Graphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gcolor3","currentReleaseVersion":"2.4.0","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/icons/128x128/gcolor3_nl.hjdskes.gcolor3.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/icons/128x128/gcolor3_nl.hjdskes.gcolor3.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-1_224x104.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-1_624x289.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-2_224x104.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-2_624x289.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/nl/hjdskes/gcolor3/302a7563d9c4969d1cee19592a7456f1/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2020-08-24","inStoreSinceDate":null}
