It is primarily intended for analysis of height field data obtained by microscopy techniques like  * Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),  * Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM),  * Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),  * Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (SNOM or NSOM) and others. However, it can be used for arbitrary height field and image analysis.</p>\n    <p>This package contains the main application and its modules. It also contains a GNOME (and Xfce) thumbnailer which creates previews for all file types known to Gwyddion.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Physics"},{"name":"Engineering"},{"name":"DataVisualization"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gwyddion","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gwyddion_gwyddion.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gwyddion_gwyddion.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
