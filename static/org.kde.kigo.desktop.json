It is also known as igo (Japanese),\n      weiqi or wei ch'i (Chinese) or baduk (Korean). Go is noted for being rich in\n      strategic complexity despite its simple rules. The game is played by two players\n      who alternately place black and white stones (playing pieces, now usually made of\n      glass or plastic) on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19x19 lines (9x9 or 13x13 for easier games).\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":"https://www.kde.org/community/donations/?app=kigo&source=appdata","translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&product=kigo","helpUrl":"https://docs.kde.org/?application=kigo","categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"BoardGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"kigo","currentReleaseVersion":"0.6.21123","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/kde/kigo.desktop/896ae1caa1ff2f4cce84517fc15934f5/icons/128x128/kigo_kigo.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/kde/kigo.desktop/896ae1caa1ff2f4cce84517fc15934f5/icons/128x128/kigo_kigo.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/kde/kigo.desktop/896ae1caa1ff2f4cce84517fc15934f5/screenshots/image-1_224x194.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/kde/kigo.desktop/896ae1caa1ff2f4cce84517fc15934f5/screenshots/image-1_752x652.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/kde/kigo.desktop/896ae1caa1ff2f4cce84517fc15934f5/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2022-03-03","inStoreSinceDate":null}
