Touching tiles with the same value are then merged into tiles with the added value of the merged ones. You start with a couple of 2-valued tiles and new tiles appear randomly after sliding. The target of the game is to reach a tile with a value of 2048 before the board is full.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"2048","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/2048_2048.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/2048_2048.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
