Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization\n      for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full\n      tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or\n      escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from\n      zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far\n      stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself,\n      that want what you have...\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As your game begins, you awaken with hazy memories of violence\n      and terror from when the world suddenly unraveled around\n      you. Now you need to explore your surroundings, and secure food,\n      water and safety. After that, who knows? Long term survival will\n      mean tapping abilities you havenâ€™t used before, learning to\n      survive in this new environment and developing new skills.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"CC-BY-SA-3.0","homepageUrl":"https://www.cataclysmdda.org","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":"https://www.transifex.com/cataclysm-dda-translators/cataclysm-dda/","bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"RolePlaying"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"cataclysm-dda-sdl","currentReleaseVersion":"0.F Frank","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/cataclysmdda/CataclysmDDA/bc962f1258490aec601070aefcaaf346/icons/128x128/cataclysm-dda-sdl_org.cataclysmdda.CataclysmDDA.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/cataclysmdda/CataclysmDDA/bc962f1258490aec601070aefcaaf346/icons/128x128/cataclysm-dda-sdl_org.cataclysmdda.CataclysmDDA.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":"2021-07-02","inStoreSinceDate":null}
