A ball travels across the screen, bouncing\noff the top and side walls. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a life when the ball touches the bottom of the field. To prevent this from happening, the player has to use a movable bar to bounce the ball upward, situated at the bottom of the window. The purpose of the game is to progress through the levels destroying all bricks present in each, and trying to get a highscore.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://apps.kde.org/kbreakout","donationUrl":"https://www.kde.org/community/donations/?app=kbreakout&source=appdata","translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&product=kbreakout","helpUrl":"https://docs.kde.org/?application=kbreakout","categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ArcadeGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"kbreakout","currentReleaseVersion":"23.08.2","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kbreakout.desktop/0e051f439fb4212223f20e713dac01d0/icons/128x128/kbreakout_kbreakout.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kbreakout.desktop/0e051f439fb4212223f20e713dac01d0/icons/128x128/kbreakout_kbreakout.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kbreakout.desktop/0e051f439fb4212223f20e713dac01d0/screenshots/image-1_224x159.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kbreakout.desktop/0e051f439fb4212223f20e713dac01d0/screenshots/image-1_752x536.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/kde/kbreakout.desktop/0e051f439fb4212223f20e713dac01d0/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2023-10-12","inStoreSinceDate":null}
