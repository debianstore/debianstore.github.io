{"flatpakAppId":"gopchop.desktop","name":"GOPchop","summary":"MPEG2 GOP-accurate editor","description":"\n    <p>gopchop cuts and merges MPEG2 video streams. gopchop uses a method to cut streams that does not require re-encoding, and therefore is fast and not prone to the artifacts and degradation of quality inherent in re-encoding. However, cuts are limited to I-frames or group-of-picture (GOP) boundaries. These frames occur frequently enough, and often times at scene transitions, so that gopchop's method is adequate for many applications.</p>\n    <p>The typical use is manually editing commercials out of recorded television programs.</p>\n    <p>Another application is splitting .VOB files from dual-layer DVD rips so that the content can be re-authored such that each half will fit on one single-layer DVD recordable.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"AudioVideo"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gopchop","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gopchop_gopchop.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/gopchop_gopchop.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
