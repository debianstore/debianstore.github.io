{"flatpakAppId":"fontmatrix.desktop","name":"Fontmatrix","summary":"A font manager","description":"\n    <p>This is a manager built with the kind of features and abilities graphic designers, layout professionals along with others have felt necessary, but modernized with some new touches.</p>\n    <p>Fontmatrix has a concept of 'tagging'. This makes it really nice to group fonts and even sub-group them logically for use in a book for instance. It also has extensive gui support for showing all glyphs in a font, previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells what kinds of advanced Open Type features are inside each font. These features have never been seen outside of a font editor. And not least, it creates a nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or reference. In short, fontmatrix is a font manager for professionals, but is nice and user friendly.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"VectorGraphics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"fontmatrix","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/fontmatrix_fontmatrix.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/fontmatrix_fontmatrix.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
