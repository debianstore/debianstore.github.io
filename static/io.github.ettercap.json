It is possible to sniff in four modes: IP Based, MAC Based,\n            ARP Based (full-duplex) and PublicARP Based (half-duplex).\n            Ettercap also has the ability to detect a switched LAN, and to use OS\n            fingerprints (active or passive) to find the geometry of the LAN.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0","homepageUrl":"https://www.ettercap-project.org","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/Ettercap/ettercap/issues","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Network"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"ettercap-graphical","currentReleaseVersion":"0.8.3","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/ettercap-graphical_ettercap.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/ettercap-graphical_ettercap.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/io/github/ettercap/4c58177440b603732eb4854ef31d4a6f/screenshots/image-1_224x150.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/io/github/ettercap/4c58177440b603732eb4854ef31d4a6f/screenshots/image-1_752x504.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/io/github/ettercap/4c58177440b603732eb4854ef31d4a6f/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
