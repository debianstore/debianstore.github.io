These results are only calculated and drawn on user demand via menu items or buttons, e.g. xnec2c is interactive and does not execute NEC2 \"commands\" in batch style as the original does.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Math"},{"name":"NumericalAnalysis"},{"name":"Electronics"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"xnec2c","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/x/xn/xnec2c.desktop/4383835c706824d628d1e37cde02e835/icons/128x128/xnec2c_xnec2c.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/x/xn/xnec2c.desktop/4383835c706824d628d1e37cde02e835/icons/128x128/xnec2c_xnec2c.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
