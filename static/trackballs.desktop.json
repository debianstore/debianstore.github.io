{"flatpakAppId":"trackballs.desktop","name":"Trackballs","summary":"Guide a marble through a maze and avoid obstacles","description":"\n    <p>Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out.</p>\n    <p>This game is not intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather inspired by it. The game is also highly configurable by using a scripting extension (Guile) and it provides a simple editor by which new levels can easily be created.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ArcadeGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"trackballs","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/tr/trackballs.desktop/19da429461ea58d994fe775ab731a88d/icons/128x128/trackballs_trackballs.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/t/tr/trackballs.desktop/19da429461ea58d994fe775ab731a88d/icons/128x128/trackballs_trackballs.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
