In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal: the extinction of all other civilisations.</p>\n    <p>This version of Freeciv is based on SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer library. It is recommended to install the »freeciv-client-gtk3« package and to use the GTK 3 client unless you really want to try this one. The SDL client offers a different look&amp;feel but lacks some functionality of the GTK 3 client.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"StrategyGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"freeciv-client-sdl","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/freeciv/sdl2/a95efbf5a35da4718a23b3d39724f4e3/icons/128x128/freeciv-client-sdl_freeciv-client.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/freeciv/sdl2/a95efbf5a35da4718a23b3d39724f4e3/icons/128x128/freeciv-client-sdl_freeciv-client.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
