{"flatpakAppId":"vitetris.desktop","name":"vitetris","summary":"Terminal-based Tetris game","description":"\n    <p>Vitetris is a terminal-based Tetris game. It can be played by one or two players, over the network or on the same keyboard.</p>\n    <p>Vitetris comes with more features and options than might be expected from a simple text mode game. Full input control, customizable appearance, netplay where both players can choose difficulty (level and height) -- unless you must have sound (or just don't like Tetris), you won't be disappointed.</p>\n    <p>Rotation, scoring, levels and speed should resemble the early Tetris games by Nintendo, with the addition of a short lock delay which makes it possible to play at higher levels. (It does not make it possible to prevent the piece from ever locking by abusing lock delay resets.)</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"BlocksGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"vitetris","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/vitetris_vitetris.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/vitetris_vitetris.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
