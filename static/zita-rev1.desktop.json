{"flatpakAppId":"zita-rev1.desktop","name":"Zita-Rev1","summary":"amazing reverb by kokkinizita - more bang per byte","description":"\n    <p>REV1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for Aeolus. Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used on a wide variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser - the early reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and right sources to some extent.</p>\n    <p>In Stereo mode a dry/wet mix control is provided, so it can be used either as an insert or in send/return mode. For mono just connect one of the two channels.</p>\n    <p>In Ambisonic mode (selected by the -B command line option) the only option is the send/return mode.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"zita-rev1","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/z/zi/zita-rev1.desktop/B328D68048B72E76B1441FEC3BD56A9B/icons/128x128/zita-rev1_zita-rev1.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/z/zi/zita-rev1.desktop/B328D68048B72E76B1441FEC3BD56A9B/icons/128x128/zita-rev1_zita-rev1.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
