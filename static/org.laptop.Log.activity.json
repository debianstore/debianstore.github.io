Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar offers an alternative to traditional \"office-desktop\" software.</p>\n    <p>Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities. They are software packages that automatically save your work - producing specific instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time. Many Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may be invited to join a collective Activity session.</p>\n    <p>Log files are created when Activities run, and by other Sugar-related processes. They list software errors, among other data, and can help diagnose software problems.</p>\n    <p>This package contains the Log activity to view Sugar-related log files.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"sugar-log-activity","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-log-activity_activity-log.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-log-activity_activity-log.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
