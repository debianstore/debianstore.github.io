{"flatpakAppId":"navit.desktop","name":"Navit","summary":"The open source vector based navigation program with routing engine","description":"\n    <p>Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine.</p>\n    <p>Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for routing and rendering of the displayed map. It's even possible to use multiple maps at a time.</p>\n    <p>The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map.</p>\n    <p>The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA GPS sensors.</p>\n    <p>The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you using speech-dispatcher.</p>\n    <p>The Debian packaging for navit doesn't provide any map. To see, where you can get maps from, see &lt;http://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Main_Page#Maps&gt;.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"Geography"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"navit","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/n/na/navit.desktop/3e8ca11a238d6f96f43f5ef1d8568139/icons/128x128/navit_navit.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/n/na/navit.desktop/3e8ca11a238d6f96f43f5ef1d8568139/icons/128x128/navit_navit.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
