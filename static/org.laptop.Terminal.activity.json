You are in charge!!","description":"\n    <p>Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.</p>\n    <p>Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software packages that automatically save your work - producing specific instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may be invited to join a collective Activity session.</p>\n    <p>Terminal provides a Bash shell command line, with access to all of the usual cryptic Unix commands, which are generally considered beyond the capabilities of elementary-school children. However, there are always exceptions.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"sugar-terminal-activity","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-terminal-activity_activity-terminal.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-terminal-activity_activity-terminal.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
