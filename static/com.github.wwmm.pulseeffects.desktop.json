It includes an\n      equalizer, limiter, compressor and a reverberation tool, just to mention\n      a few. To complement this there is also a built in spectrum analyzer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Because PulseEffects uses the default PulseAudio sound server it will\n      work with most, if not all, applications you use. All supported\n      applications are presented in the main window, where each can be enabled\n      individually.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Besides manipulating sound output, PulseEffects is able to apply effects\n      to an input device, such as a microphone. This is, for example, useful in\n      audio recording, but it also works well during voice conversations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When PulseEffects is launched it will conveniently remember the\n      configuration used in the last session. It is also possible to save\n      all the current settings as profiles.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":"Wellington Wallace","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0","homepageUrl":"https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":"https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/issues","helpUrl":"https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/blob/master/README.md","categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"pulseeffects","currentReleaseVersion":"4.8.4","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/icons/128x128/pulseeffects_pulseeffects.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/icons/128x128/pulseeffects_pulseeffects.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-1_224x121.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-1_752x408.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-2_224x121.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-2_752x408.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-3_224x121.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-3_752x408.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-4_224x121.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-4_752x408.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-5_224x125.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-5_752x422.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/com/github/wwmm.pulseeffects.desktop/900E93DB80AC1DD48334FA3DB07F5473/screenshots/image-5_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2020-12-21","inStoreSinceDate":null}
