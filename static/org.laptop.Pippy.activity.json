Here you can use examples to begin learning the language your computer understands called \"Python\".","description":"\n    <p>Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.</p>\n    <p>Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software packages that automatically save your work - producing specific instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may be invited to join a collective Activity session.</p>\n    <p>Pippy allows the student to examine, execute, and modify simple Python programs.  In addition it is possible to write Python statements to play sounds, calculate  expressions, or make simple text based interactive games.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"sugar-pippy-activity","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-pippy-activity_activity-icon.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/sugar-pippy-activity_activity-icon.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
