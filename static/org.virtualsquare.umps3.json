{"flatpakAppId":"org.virtualsquare.umps3","name":"µMPS3","summary":"Virtual machine simulator based around the MIPS R2/3000 microprocessor","description":"\n    <p>\n      µMPS is an educational computer system architecture and an accompanying emulator designed from the ground up to\nachieve the right trade-off between simplicity and elegance on one side, and realism on the other. This makes µMPS ideally suited for use in education, such as hands-on operating systems or computer architecture university courses.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The µMPS processor implements the MIPS I instruction set, and can therefore be supported out of the box by existing\nMIPS compilers. The architecture details a complete set of I/O devices (terminals, disks, flash devices, printers, and network adapters) that feature a clean, consistent, programming interface.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The emulator comes with built-in debugging features and an easy to use graphical user interface. Apart from the\nemulator itself, several support utilities are provided that can get you quickly started in developing programs for µMPS.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Emulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"umps3","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/umps3_org.virtualsquare.umps3.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/umps3_org.virtualsquare.umps3.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-1_224x162.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-1_752x544.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-2_224x162.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-2_752x545.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"},{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-3_224x162.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-3_752x545.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/org/virtualsquare/umps3/1efaeda1d5e27527a99c82d9c62640c2/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
