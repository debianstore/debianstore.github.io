Who finishes with more tiles wins!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      GNOME Reversi allows you to play both a classic reversi game, and the\n      reversed variant, where the goal is to finish with less tile than your\n      opponent.\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":"The GNOME Project","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0+","homepageUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Reversi","donationUrl":"https://www.gnome.org/friends/","translateUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject","bugtrackerUrl":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/iagno/issues","helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"BoardGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"iagno","currentReleaseVersion":"3.38.1","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Reversi/7fdf2ee8b5870688ef1a59422883e261/icons/128x128/iagno_org.gnome.Reversi.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Reversi/7fdf2ee8b5870688ef1a59422883e261/icons/128x128/iagno_org.gnome.Reversi.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Reversi/7fdf2ee8b5870688ef1a59422883e261/screenshots/image-1_224x143.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Reversi/7fdf2ee8b5870688ef1a59422883e261/screenshots/image-1_624x398.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Reversi/7fdf2ee8b5870688ef1a59422883e261/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2020-10-03","inStoreSinceDate":null}
