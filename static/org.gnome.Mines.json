{"flatpakAppId":"org.gnome.Mines","name":"GNOME Mines","summary":"Clear hidden mines from a minefield","description":"\n    <p>\n      GNOME Mines is a puzzle game where you search for hidden mines. Flag the\n      spaces with mines as quickly as possible to make the board a safer place. You\n      win the game when you’ve flagged every mine on the board. Be careful not to\n      trigger one, or the game is over!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You can select the size of the field you want to play on at the start of the\n      game. If you get stuck, you can ask for a hint: there’s a time penalty, but\n      that’s better than hitting a mine!\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":"The GNOME Project","projectLicense":"GPL-3.0+","homepageUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Mines","donationUrl":"http://www.gnome.org/friends/","translateUrl":"https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject","bugtrackerUrl":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-mines/issues","helpUrl":"https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-mines/stable/","categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"LogicGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"gnome-mines","currentReleaseVersion":"3.31.90","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Mines/ee0b2fa77759e80ba9461f51bea89c44/icons/128x128/gnome-mines_org.gnome.Mines.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Mines/ee0b2fa77759e80ba9461f51bea89c44/icons/128x128/gnome-mines_org.gnome.Mines.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Mines/ee0b2fa77759e80ba9461f51bea89c44/screenshots/image-1_224x168.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Mines/ee0b2fa77759e80ba9461f51bea89c44/screenshots/image-1_624x469.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/org/gnome/Mines/ee0b2fa77759e80ba9461f51bea89c44/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2019-02-04","inStoreSinceDate":null}
