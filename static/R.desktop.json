{"flatpakAppId":"R.desktop","name":"R","summary":"R software environment for statistical computing and graphics","description":"\n    <p>R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.</p>\n    <p>The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages: Becker, Chambers &amp; Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.</p>\n    <p>The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.</p>\n    <p>Additionally, several thousand extension \"packages\" are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages, named 'r-cran-&lt;name&gt;'.</p>\n    <p>This package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Graphics"},{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Math"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"r-base-core","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/r/r./r.desktop/3b40d13d9ccc606c1e5e352c98b2a21d/icons/128x128/r-base-core_rlogo_icon.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/r/r./r.desktop/3b40d13d9ccc606c1e5e352c98b2a21d/icons/128x128/r-base-core_rlogo_icon.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
