{"flatpakAppId":"cutesdr.desktop","name":"CuteSdr","summary":"Spectrum display and demodulator of IQ radio data","description":"\n    <p>The CuteSDR application's primary purpose is for spawning custom applications or for educational use. It is NOT a full featured program as it is purposely kept simple in order for developers to more easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was to use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or special drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection. The main gui and framework is written by Moe Wheatly, AE4JY.</p>\n    <p>CuteSDR itself has only a network interface and will directly support the RFSPACE NetSDR and SDR-IP radios. The siqs_ftdi and SDRxxServer applications (packaged separately) provide network interfaces to RFSPACE USB devices.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Utility"},{"name":"HamRadio"},{"name":"Tuner"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"cutesdr","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/cutesdr_cutesdr.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/cutesdr_cutesdr.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
