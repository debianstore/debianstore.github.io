{"flatpakAppId":"net.sourceforge.wavbreaker","name":"wavbreaker","summary":"GUI tool to split WAV, MP2 and MP3 files","description":"\n    <p>\n    wavbreaker's purpose in life is to take a WAV file and break it up\n    into multiple WAV files. It makes a clean break at the correct position\n    to burn the files to an Audio CD without any dead air between the tracks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    wavbreaker also supports breaking up MP2 and MP3 files without re-encoding\n    meaning it's fast and there is no generational loss. Decoding (using mpg123)\n    is only done for playback and waveform display.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The GUI displays a waveform summary of the entire file at the top. The middle\n    portion displays a zoomed-in view that allows you to select where to start\n    playing and where it will make the break. The bottom portion contains a list\n    of track breaks. You may change file names and uncheck parts that you do not\n    want to have written out to disk when saving.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    There is also a command line tool wavmerge to merge WAV files together.\n    If you download a show and don't like how it was tracked, you can merge them\n    together with wavmerge and then break them back up with wavbreaker. The\n    wavmerge tool will only work on files that have the same format (for example,\n    44.100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit sample size, etc.).\n    </p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":"GPL-2.0+","homepageUrl":"https://wavbreaker.sourceforge.io/","donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"AudioVideo"},{"name":"Audio"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"wavbreaker","currentReleaseVersion":"0.16","currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/net/sourceforge/wavbreaker/eae0569241e47a69e6533a1a86155507/icons/128x128/wavbreaker_net.sourceforge.wavbreaker.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/net/sourceforge/wavbreaker/eae0569241e47a69e6533a1a86155507/icons/128x128/wavbreaker_net.sourceforge.wavbreaker.png","screenshots":[{"thumbUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/net/sourceforge/wavbreaker/eae0569241e47a69e6533a1a86155507/screenshots/image-1_224x190.png","imgMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/net/sourceforge/wavbreaker/eae0569241e47a69e6533a1a86155507/screenshots/image-1_752x640.png","imgDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/noble/net/sourceforge/wavbreaker/eae0569241e47a69e6533a1a86155507/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"}],"currentReleaseDate":"2022-12-20","inStoreSinceDate":null}
