It provides a rich environment to help writers create their first draft and then further refine and edit their masterpiece.</p>\n    <p>Features:  - Writing modes: Manuskript offers two writing modes: one “fiction” mode    with all the tools for fiction writers (summary, characters, plot,    world/context, etc.), and one “simple” mode, with only the writing tab.  - Outliner: You can organize your thoughts and snippets in a hierarchical    manner. Organize them as you wish, reorganize them on the go.  - Customizable distraction-free mode: Get rid of all distraction while    writing or lock yourself until you’ve reached a certain goal.  - Novel assistant: Use the snowflake method to grow your single genius idea    in a coherent whole, with complex characters, intricate plots and detailed    universe.  - Open and plain-text file format: Depending on your configuration,    everything is either stored zipped in one single file or as several small    text files in one folder (to allow versioning and collaborative editing).  - Index Cards: Use index cards to organise your thoughts: notes, scenes,    chapters, etc.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Office"},{"name":"WordProcessor"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"manuskript","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/manuskript_manuskript.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/manuskript_manuskript.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
