It uses the NASA SRTM and later NASADEM datasets (The latter has the voids removed using ASTER data). The relevant data is downloaded and excerpted, geolocated to the desired co-ordinate system, resampled to a mesh grid, an offset to local grid added if required, the result displayed, and saved in survex (.svx) or therion (.th) format. It is written in java.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Science"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"terraintool","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/terraintool_terraintool.png","iconMobileUrl":"http://localhost:7777/repo/appstream/x86_64/icons/128x128/terraintool_terraintool.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
