Produced by Epic Games (then Epic MegaGames), it was first released in 1994. The fast-paced, colourful gameplay proved popular, and the game won PC Format's Arcade Game of the Year award. Many people still fondly recall the shareware versions.</p>\n    <p>With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it has become necessary to use emulators to play old DOS games. Jazz Jackrabbit™ deserves more - and would benefit greatly from new features.</p>\n    <p>To play, you will need the files from one of the original games. Current releases of `game-data-packager' are able to generate a suitable data package from the Jazz Jackrabbit Collection as published on GOG.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"ActionGame"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"openjazz","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/o/op/OpenJazz.desktop/33534B47480CAC0FEA59F9CBF4AA758A/icons/128x128/openjazz_OpenJazz.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/o/op/OpenJazz.desktop/33534B47480CAC0FEA59F9CBF4AA758A/icons/128x128/openjazz_OpenJazz.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
