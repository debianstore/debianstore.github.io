Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.</p>\n    <p>Unlike most other open source Atari ST emulators which try to provide a good environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old Atari games and demos. Because of this, it may be somewhat slower than less accurate emulators.</p>\n  ","developerName":null,"projectLicense":null,"homepageUrl":null,"donationUrl":null,"translateUrl":null,"bugtrackerUrl":null,"helpUrl":null,"categories":[{"name":"Game"},{"name":"Emulator"}],"downloadFlatpakRefUrl":"hatari","currentReleaseVersion":null,"currentReleaseDescription":null,"iconDesktopUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/h/ha/hatariui.desktop/47501A902952E170208405DF7E1FA279/icons/128x128/hatari_hatari.png","iconMobileUrl":"https://appstream.ubuntu.com/media/jammy/h/ha/hatariui.desktop/47501A902952E170208405DF7E1FA279/icons/128x128/hatari_hatari.png","screenshots":[],"currentReleaseDate":null,"inStoreSinceDate":null}
